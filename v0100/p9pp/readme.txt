This is the cpp preprocessor from the Plan9 OS.

It has been ANSI-C'fied and lightly cleaned up. It should compile (even with
Smaller C if preprocessed (see the -ppg option)) and minimally function.

It still has bugs (most notably in handling of ##) and fails on examples from
the C standard.

This is an experiment. It is not decided yet whether this preprocessor will be
used with Smaller C.
